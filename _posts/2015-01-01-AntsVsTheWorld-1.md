For the first post in this series, we present you a colony of [jumping jack ants (*Myrmecia pilosula*)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_jumper_ant) attacking a [green bellied huntsman spider (*Micrommata virescens*)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrommata_virescens) easily 10 times the size of each individual ants. But size does not matter when you have friends to help you and a powerful, venomous sting.
