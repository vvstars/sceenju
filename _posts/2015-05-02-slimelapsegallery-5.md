*If you've ever watched a slime mold move, you have more patience (and spare time) than I do. If you prefer 'real action' over 'real time', then [\#SlimeLapseGallery](/category/slimelapsegallery/) is the place for you. Brought to you by the SwarmLab, see all the best timelapse videos of slime mold, from the web and from our lab.*

#### Episode 5: Slime mold in its natural habitat

Today's [\#SlimeLapseGallery](/category/slimelapsegallery/) video shows a slime mold - probably the ['dog vomit' slime mold, *Fuligo septica*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuligo_septica) - moving up a log from the forest floor over 5 hours. The pulsating behavior that you see is not respiration, but the consequence of the oscillations occurring within the slime mold that drive locomotion and decision-making, as well as distributing cytoplasm, nutrients and wastes.
