#### Episode 2: Matabele Ants vs. Termite Soldiers

For this second episode, we present you a classic: the attack of a termite colony by an ant colony narrated by David Attenborough in the BBC series ["Life In The Undergrowth - Supersocieties"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002sfcz). Here, the protagonists are the African mound-building termites (*Macrotermes sp.*) and the [Matabele ants (*Pachycondyla analis*)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachycondyla_analis). The Matabele ants "are named after the Matabele tribe of fierce warriors who overwhelmed many other tribes during the 1800s" (source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachycondyla_analis)). They feed exclusively on termites, forming raiding columns of up to 1,000 individuals that makes it for some epic battles. More on the Matabele ants can be found [here](http://www.arkive.org/matabele-ant/pachycondyla-analis/).

Now shh! Let's listen to Sir David Attenborough :-)
