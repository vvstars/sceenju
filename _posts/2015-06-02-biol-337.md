description: 
    Understanding collective intelligence is one of the main challenges of contemporary science. Social dynamics are
    essential for the organization of gregarious and social organisms, and they are an important part of many human
    activities including the selection of social and industrial norms, the growing use of crowd-sourcing and viral
    marketing in social networks, and the influence of media and entourage on the outcome of democratic processes. This 
    course will provide an overview of the fundamental principles underlying the organization of animal societies. It 
    will include detailed consideration of the behavioral, social and physical processes that are responsible for the 
    coordination of activities in large animal and human groups.
