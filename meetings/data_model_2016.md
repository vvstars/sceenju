title: First Collaborative Workshop on Data and Modeling in Collective Behavior
---

###### Where: [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu), Newark, NJ

###### When: May 23-25, 2016

###### Organizers: [Jason Graham](https://sites.google.com/site/jasonmgrahamus/) (University Scranton) & [Simon Garnier](http://www.theswarmlab.con) (NJIT)

---

The goal of this workshop is to provide researchers coming from both mathematics and biology with experience in working collaboratively to model and analyze data produced by research in collective behavior.

During the workshop, mathematicians and biologists will work in teams toward constructing mathematical and/or computational models of biological data. Each team will be tasked with exploring, analyzing and modeling original data sets provided by biologist attendees. The event will be similar in spirit to a hackathon in computer science, with the goal of finding new ways to understand the provided biological data. Regular debriefing sessions will be organized throughout the 3 days of the workshop in order for each team to provide updates to and receive feedback from the rest of the participants on their progress.

This should provide valuable training and experience for researchers coming from both fields, as well as an opportunity to create new collaborations beyond the workshop itself.

Ultimately, one of our goals is for this workshop to become an annual or biannual event that will impact research on collective animal and human behavior by promoting close collaboration between mathematicians and other scientists working on understanding the organization and functioning of animal and human societies.
